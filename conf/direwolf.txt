C# These are the most likely settings you might change just to get started:
C#
C#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
C#
C#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and 
C#			change NOCALL to your own.
C#

C#
C#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and 
C#			modify for your call, location, etc.
C#
C#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
C#
C#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
C#			Most people will probably use the given example.
C#			Just remove the "#" from the start of the line
C#			to enable it.
C#
C#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
C#
C#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between 
C#			radio and internet servers.
C#
C#
C# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.

C# Pick a suitable modem speed based on your situation.
C#	1200 	Most common for VHF/UHF.  Default if not specified.
C#	2400	QPSK compatible with MFJ-2400, and probably PK232-2400 & KPC-2400.
C#	300	Low speed for HF SSB.  Default tones 1600 & 1800.
C#	EAS	Emergency Alert System (EAS) Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME).
C#	9600	G3RUH style - Can't use Microphone and Speaker connections.
C#	AIS	International system for tracking ships on VHF.
C#			Also uses 9600 bps so Speaker connection won't work.
